# Sign-language-detection-using-Teachable-machine
This project focuses on real-time hand gesture recognition using the OpenCV library and a pre-trained deep learning model. The goal is to detect and recognize hand gestures from a live video stream captured by a webcam. The project consists of two main files, projectdip.py and test.py, each serving different purposes.
